## China Trip 2025 — Viability Review & Action Items (Draft)

### Overall verdict
- **Viable itinerary** with excellent autumn timing and logical routing. Main sensitivities are: a very long rail day on Oct 24, multiple **high-altitude** days (Huanglong, Dagu Glacier, Mt. Emei summit), and several **unbooked items** (late trip hotels, trains, some transfers/tickets).

### Key gaps to resolve
- **Hotels (late trip):** Missing bookings for
  - **Chengdu (Nov 1–2)** — 1 night
  - **Emeishan city base (Nov 2–3)** — 1 night
  - **Chengdu (Nov 3–5)** — 2 nights
- **Inbound flight passengers:** BKK→CKG (HU424) document lists only **CHAMNONG/NICK MR**. If two travelers are going inbound, add/verify the second passenger.
- **Name consistency:** Driver confirmation lists passenger as **CHANGNONG NICK** (typo). Standardize to match passport (appears to be **CHAMNONG** across most docs).
- **Baggage on HU424:** Not specified. Verify allowance to avoid airport surprises.
- **Chengdu 1-night (Oct 28–29):** Price listed but no explicit "Paid" tag. Confirm payment/cancellation window.
- **Breakfast counts vs guests:** Some hotels include breakfast for 1 (e.g., Chengdu Oct 24–26). If 2 adults are traveling, expect add-on costs or request add-on breakfast.

### Plan risks and mitigations
- **Oct 24: Zhangjiajie → Chongqing → Chengdu (HSR x2)**
  - Risk: Long day with connection sensitivity. Mitigations: book earliest feasible first leg; choose a connection with ≥90–120 min buffer; pre-book Wulingyuan→ZJJ West transfer; pack food; keep a backup later Chengdu train.
  - Optional alternative: Consider DYG→TFU flight to reduce fatigue (trade cost for time/energy).
- **High altitude days**
  - Huanglong (up to ~4,000+ m), Dagu Glacier summit (~4,860 m), Emei summit (~3,077 m).
  - Mitigations: strict layering (base/fleece/shell), hat/gloves, sunscreen/sunglasses; hydrate; avoid alcohol night before; consider portable oxygen for Dagu; monitor symptoms and descend if unwell.
- **Crowds** (peak foliage + weekends): Fenghuang (Oct 18), Jiuzhaigou (Oct 27), Huanglong (Oct 28), Dagu (Nov 1), Leshan (Nov 2), Tianmen/ZJJ upper areas (Oct 21–22).
  - Mitigations: go at/just before opening; pre-book tickets; accept trimmed scope if queues spike; prefer boat at Leshan on Sunday.

### Booking priorities (do ASAP)
- **High-Speed Rail (8 legs):** Pre-sale windows are typically short; set reminders to book at open on 12306/agent app.
  - Oct 17: Chongqing → Huaihua South
  - Oct 24: ZJJ West → Chongqing West, then Chongqing West → Chengdu East
  - Oct 26: Chengdu East → Jiuzhaigou Station
  - Oct 28: HuanglongJiuzhai Station → Chengdu East
  - Nov 2: Chengdu → Leshan; Leshan → Emeishan
  - Nov 3: Emeishan → Chengdu
- **Private drivers/transfers (not yet booked):**
  - Oct 15: Wulong Karst day trip (round trip from Chongqing)
  - Oct 24: Wulingyuan → ZJJ West (pre-dawn likely)
  - Oct 26: Jiuzhaigou Station → hotel (Zhangzha)
  - Oct 28: JZG hotel → Huanglong → HLJ HSR station (with luggage, time-critical)
  - Oct 30–Nov 1: DeeTrip is booked and aligned; confirm pickup times/locations each day.
- **Attraction tickets (book ahead where possible):**
  - Wulong Karst; Tianmen Mountain; Zhangjiajie National Forest Park (consider 2-day plan); Jiuzhaigou; Huanglong (cable car); Dagu Glacier (cable car); Leshan (boat strongly recommended on Sun, Nov 2); Emei (bus + cable car); Chengdu Panda Base (enter at opening).

### Cross-checks by document set
- **Airlines**
  - Inbound: HU424 on Oct 14 to CKG looks correct; confirm baggage; verify second passenger if applicable.
  - Outbound: CA471 on Nov 5 TFU→BKK lists two passengers (Nick + Arpaporn) and looks consistent.
- **Hotels** (Oct 14 → Nov 1 all covered and consistent with itinerary)
  - Names/dates/rooms align well with the day-by-day. Breakfast inclusions vary (note Chengdu Oct 24–26 = breakfast for 1).
  - Oct 28–29 Chengdu transit: price is shown; confirm payment status.
- **Driver (Oct 30–Nov 1)**
  - DeeTrip itinerary aligns with hotel sequence: Shuangqiaogou → Bipenggou → Dagu → Chengdu.
  - Fix the surname typo on the voucher; confirm accepted payment currency/method and any deposit/receipt requirements.

### Itinerary alignment notes
- The note in `index.html` that flags a "location mismatch" for the Shuangqiaogou hotel appears outdated. The hotel address places it in the Mount Siguniang area (Xiaojin/Rilong), which matches the current plan for Oct 29–30.
- `index.html` header "Hotels (15 Bookings)" currently enumerates 13 items (10 booked + 3 to-do). Either adjust the count to 13, or add the remaining hotel entries once booked.

### Practical ops checklist
- Digital payments and ride-hailing: Install/verify **Alipay/WeChat Pay** and **Didi**; keep hotel addresses in Chinese.
- Luggage: Confirm station/hotel luggage storage on key days (Oct 28 Huanglong + HLJ HSR day; Nov 2 Leshan boat day).
- Documents: Keep passport names consistent across all bookings; carry printed/emailed confirmations; verify visa/entry requirements per passport.
- Health: Travel insurance that covers high-altitude areas; bring basic meds; sun protection.

### Quick next actions (high priority)
1) Book the three late-trip hotel segments (Nov 1–2, Nov 2–3, Nov 3–5).
2) Set HSR pre-sale reminders and purchase all 8 legs at window open.
3) Lock in drivers for Oct 15, Oct 24, Oct 26, Oct 28 (times and meeting points).
4) Purchase/hold attraction tickets with time slots where applicable (Tianmen, ZJJ, JZG, HLG, Dagu, Leshan boat, Emei, Panda).
5) Standardize all names (fix "CHANGNONG" → "CHAMNONG"); verify inbound passenger list; confirm HU424 baggage.
6) Update `index.html` counts and remove the outdated Shuangqiaogou mismatch note after confirming above.
