            <h3>Key Weather &amp; Time Takeaways:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Layering is Essential:</strong> Encountering mild to freezing conditions requires thermal base layers, fleece mid-layers, and a waterproof/windproof outer shell. Hat, gloves, scarf crucial for high altitudes/cold mornings.</li>
                <li><strong>Altitude &amp; Cold:</strong> Biggest challenges are cold at high altitudes (JZG, HLG, Siguniang, Bipenggou, Dagu, Emei Summit). Be prepared for freezing temperatures.</li>
                <li><strong>Fog/Cloud Risk:</strong> Famous viewpoints (Tianmen, ZJJ, HLG, Emei, Dagu) frequently affected by fog/low cloud in autumn. Mentally prepare for obscured views.</li>
                <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Strong sun at high altitudes (even when cold). Bring sunglasses &amp; sunscreen.</li>
                <li><strong>Daylight Hours:</strong> Days getting shorter. Sunset ~18:00-18:30. Plan accordingly, especially for hikes/late afternoon activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Daily Forecasts:</strong> Use reliable weather apps (local ones often better) daily, especially before mountain excursions.</li>

<section id="time-allocation">
            <h2>Time Allocation Analysis</h2>
            <p>(Focus points and potential skips on key sightseeing days)</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Day 2: Wulong Karst (Approx. 4-6 hours on site):</strong> Tight but sufficient if efficient. <em>Focus:</em> Three Natural Bridges main path, Longshuixia Gorge loop. <em>Skip:</em> Lengthy breaks, optional side paths if queues long.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 3: Chongqing City (Full Day):</strong> Sufficient for 3-4 key sites. <em>Focus:</em> Prioritize based on interest (Ciqikou, Hongyadong (evening!), Eling Park/Cableway). <em>Skip:</em> Trying to fit too much; minor museums unless specific interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 5: Fenghuang Ancient Town (Full Day):</strong> Ample. <em>Focus:</em> River walks (both banks), alleys, bridges, evening lights. Boat ride optional. <em>Skip:</em> Inside every residence museum unless interested.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 6: Furong Zhen (Afternoon + potential morning):</strong> Sufficient. <em>Focus:</em> Waterfall views (various points, behind curtain), stilted houses. <em>Skip:</em> Extensive exploration far from waterfall if leaving early next day.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 8: Tianmen Mountain (Approx. 6-8 hours on site):</strong> Generally sufficient, but <strong>highly queue-dependent</strong>. <em>Focus:</em> Long Cable Car, significant Cliff Walk section (inc. 1 glass skywalk), Tianmen Cave (escalators). <em>Skip:</em> All glass skywalks if queues extreme, lengthy temple visit if pressured, less popular side trails. Choose descent (bus/cable car) based on efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 9: Zhangjiajie Park - Upper Areas (Full Day):</strong> Sufficient for highlights. <em>Focus:</em> Yuanjiajie (Bailong Elevator up, key viewpoints), Tianzi Mountain (Eco-bus transfer, key viewpoints, Cableway down). <em>Skip:</em> Hiking long distances between viewpoints (use buses), minor viewpoints if transfers slow.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 10: Zhangjiajie Park - Lower Areas (Full Day):</strong> Sufficient. <em>Focus:</em> Golden Whip Stream (significant portion walk), Ten-Mile Gallery (monorail or walk). <em>Skip:</em> Huangshizhai (requires separate cable car), hiking entire Golden Whip Stream (7.5km one way).</li>
                <li><strong>Day 12: Chengdu Free Day (Full Day):</strong> Ample time for 2-3 main city sites or relaxed exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 14: Jiuzhaigou (Full Day - Approx. 8-9 hours in park):</strong> Decent allocation, but park is vast &amp; <strong>crowded</strong>. Requires efficiency. <em>Focus (Essential Stops):</em> Rize Valley (Five Flower Lake, Pearl Shoal W'fall, Panda/Arrow Bamboo Lakes, Mirror Lake), Zechawa Valley (Long Lake, Five-Colour Pond), Shuzheng Valley (Nuorilang W'fall, Shuzheng Lakes/Village). <em>Skip:</em> Hiking long sections between sites (use bus!), stopping at every named spot (prioritize bolded), Zharu Valley.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 15: Huanglong (Approx. 3-4 hours on site):</strong> <strong>VERY TIGHT</strong>, especially with altitude &amp; travel. <em>Focus:</em> Cable Car UP, walk elevated boardwalk loop down past main ponds towards <strong>Five-Coloured Pond</strong> (highest, most scenic). <em>Skip:</em> Long walk up from entrance, full walk down (~4km path) might be too slow (return via cable car if needed), brief look at Huanglong Temple near top. Assess time/energy/altitude constantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 17: Mount Siguniang - Shuangqiao Valley (Approx. 2-3 hours in valley):</strong> <strong>VERY TIGHT</strong> (scenic drive-through). <em>Focus:</em> Ride eco-bus, hop off briefly at 2-3 major viewpoints (ask driver/guide). Get photos/impressions. <em>Skip:</em> Any hiking, expecting immersive experience. Changping/Haizi valleys skipped entirely.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 18: Bipenggou Valley (Approx. 4-6 hours):</strong> Sufficient for main highlights. <em>Focus:</em> Park bus/battery cars to key autumn colour lakes/areas (e.g., Panyang Lake, Zhuoma Lake, Moon Lake). Enjoy valley views. <em>Skip:</em> Long hiking side trails, spending too much time at entry/exit points if middle section is peak scenery.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 19: Dagu Glacier (Approx. 3-4 hours on site):</strong> Sufficient for summit goal. <em>Focus:</em> Bus ride, <strong>Cable Car to Summit (4860m)</strong>, time on summit platform (views, photos, cafe), Cable car down. <em>Skip:</em> Extensive lower valley exploration unless summit fogged in.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 20: Leshan Giant Buddha (Approx. 3-5 hours on site):</strong> <strong>TIGHT</strong>, especially on Sunday travel day. <em>Focus:</em> Choose ONE main viewing method: Boat Tour (panoramic, efficient) OR Stairs (close-up, potentially HOURS queueing). <em>Skip:</em> The other viewing method, adjacent Wuyou Temple/Mahao Tombs if time very limited.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 21: Mount Emei Summit (Approx. 2-3 hours AT summit):</strong> <strong>TIGHT</strong> for summit experience + travel time. <em>Focus:</em> Efficient bus to Leidongping, walk to cable car, cable car UP, Golden Summit (statue, temples exterior, viewing platforms), cable car DOWN, bus DOWN. <em>Skip:</em> Everything else on mountain (mid-level temples, monkeys, hiking). Pure summit strike.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 22: Panda Base (Approx. 3 hours AM):</strong> Sufficient if going EARLY. <em>Focus:</em> Giant Panda enclosures (adult, sub-adult, cub), Nursery/Kindergarten (check activity). <em>Skip:</em> Red Pandas if short on time, museum/cinema unless interested.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Summary of Tightest Spots &amp; Key Decisions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Huanglong (Day 15):</strong> Be ruthlessly efficient. Use cable car both ways if needed. Prioritize Five-Coloured Pond area. Altitude is a major factor.</li>
                <li><strong>Jiuzhaigou (Day 14):</strong> Stick to buses, prioritize MUST-SEE spots. Accept you won't see every corner. Start extremely early.</li>
                <li><strong>Mount Siguniang (Day 17):</strong> Accept it's a scenic drive-through, not in-depth exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Leshan (Day 20):</strong> Decide beforehand: Stairs or Boat? (Boat strongly recommended for this itinerary/day). Don't try both.</li>
                <li><strong>Mount Emei (Day 21):</strong> Focus 100% on summit logistics. Don't get sidetracked by mid-mountain attractions.</li>
                <li><strong>Tianmen Mountain (Day 8):</strong> Monitor queue times for cable cars/buses/escalators and adjust plans (e.g., skip a skywalk if queues are excessive).</li>
            </ul>
